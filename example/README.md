A simple Nitro example
======================

This is a very simple example. To start the application just give:

    $ ringo config.js 

Then browse localhost:8080:

    localhost:8080/
        A simple template with one interpolated param

    localhost:8080/hello
        The mandatory Hello World

    localhost:8080/stream
        A simple streaming example
	
There is not much to see in this example so go on and try the more advanced [appengine-blog-example](http://www.nitrojs.org/appenginejs/appengine-blog-example.tar.gz) example!
